# 🛎️ About our work

### The primary source of inspiration for this poster is the technology and futuristic vision.

### We noticed the relation between the word “program” in “Trainee Program” with “computer programming” and “TV program” then we thought about the idea of making computer and TV monitor the key visual of our artwork. Besides, the Trainee  Program is held by the Computer Science Department, so we consider the technology concept a perfect choice.

### During the process of making this poster, we understood the importance of technology in bringing knowledge, skills, and tools for solving problems. For this reason, we wanted to create a bright colorful poster full of energy and hope towards a new era of innovation.
